# React Job Portal

Use [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.  
The app was bootstrapped with `npx create-expo-app@latest -e with-router ./`

## Description

This app was created for the purpose of familiarising oneself with react-native.  
A tutorial from [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ3bGvy0WAY) was followed.  
Axios was used to fetch data from JSearch on RapidAPI.

## Running the App

```sh
git clone https://github.com/duckyfuz/native_test_jobs.git
npm install
npm start
```

If Expo is unable to load the app, there is likely a conflict with the firewall.  
Either disable the firewall or run `expo-cli start --tunnel` instead.
